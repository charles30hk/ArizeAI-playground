To be updated.  

The jupyter notebook demonstrates my use of ArizeAI Phoenix for LLM observability monitoring. (Tracks latency per stage,  assits in LLM tracing to examine chaining, inputs, and outputs) 
I have also used ArizeAI Phoenix to leverage GPT4 to perform automatic evaluation on whether LLM output through RAG are relevant or hallucinated.
